Obtaining the trademark registration certificate in a particular country means that you are the only one who can use this trademark to identify and distinguish your goods or services and gives you also the right to prevent others from using identical or similar trademarks in a country of registration.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Usually, enterprises are willing to choose trademarks that reflect the nature of their goods or services. Although this is a valid target, direct description of products or services lowers the strength and exclusivity of trademark. Our advice on trademark selection will enable you to choose a strong and exclusive trademark that provides the same desired identification to your goods and services. We also examine the validity of the trademark according to the official language of the country in question.</p>
                <br>

                  <p>A patent gives the patentee exclusive right to sell, use manufacture and license the invention. It also gives the power to the inventor to exclude all third parties from using, distributing, or selling the invention without the patentee's permission.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Before filing application, it is very important to perform patentability search to find out whether to register the invention or not. Under patentability search, we at AIP&T search all in-force and expired patents plus any previous technology to find out whether or not a particular invention is novel and has inventive step.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Patent drafting (drafting specification and claims) is the most sophisticated area of law because the person drafting the application has to follow the very complex instructions to claim the exact invention, avoid claiming prior
                  art technology, and to avoid conflict between patent claims and patent specification. At AIP&T, we provide legal support to carry out the drafting process.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Infringement search is used to determine whether or not a particular invention is infringing a protected patent. This type of search is more limited compare to patentability search because it only examines the invention in light of protected patent while patentability search examine the invention in light of protected/expired patent, and all the prior unprotected technology.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Registration process is the third step for protecting invention after patentability search and drafting patent application. It is very important to know that a patentable invention is not protected by law in most of the countries covered by our service and not enforceable against third parties until the local Patent Office grants the inventor the patent certificate.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>For protecting your patent in the above mentioned countries, you must be aware that there are (3) three international treaties governing patent registration, namely; Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), Paris Convention, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) : Filing under the PCT system provides (3) three years period to the applicant to claim priority from the original patent application in any of the member states of the PCT.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Paris Convention : According to Article 4 (c) of the Paris Convention, filing a patent application under the Paris Convention provides (12) twelve months period to the applicant to claim priority from the original patent application in any of the member states of the Paris Convention.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) : The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has its central patent registration system which is enforced in all the (6) six GCC countries; namely: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Bahrain. Thus, GCC patent law gives
                  patentees acheter cialisthe right to protect their patents in all the above mentioned countries through a single registration.</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Patent Law Treaty (PLT) : The Patent Law Treaty (PLT) provides for unifrom requirements for filing and maintaining national or regional patent applications, for example, communications and representations regarding patents or patent applications.</p>

This type of search is more limited compared to a patentability search because it only examines the invention in light of the existing patent, while a patentability search examines the invention in light of the valid/expired patents, and all the prior unprotected technology.

                  <h2> Drafting Patent Application</h2>
                  <hr>
                  <p>Patent drafting (drafting specification and claims) is the most sophisticated area of patent law because the person drafting the application has to follow complex instructions to precisely claim the invention, avoid claiming prior art technology, and avoid conflict between patent claims and patent specification. At AIP&T we are very qualified in patent drafting and can carry out the drafting process of all kinds of technologies.</p>

            <h2> Industrial Design Overview</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Today, global business organizations have realized the importance of protecting their market by protecting the uniqueness of the "design" of their products. This design helps the consumer to relate a particular product to a particular brand of business,thus creating a monopoly in the market.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Generally, industrial design laws provide a protection period of (10) ten years to an industrial design.
            In contrast to patents, protecting an industrial design does not require the proof of an "Inventive Step" (non-obviousness).</p>
            <br>
            <p>All that are required to protect an industrial design are
            "Uniqueness" and "Novelty".</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Locarno Classification is an international classification used for the purposes of the registration of industrial designs. It was set up by an agreement concluded at a diplomatic conference held in Locarno in 1968: the Locarno Agreement Establishing an International Classification for Industrial Designs.The Locarno Classification comprises a list of classes and subclasses with explanatory notes and an alphabetical list of goods in which industrial designs are incorporated, with an indication of the classes and subclasses into which they fall. Presently, there are 52 contracting states to the Locarno Agreement.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Paris Convention : According to Article 4 (c) of the Paris Convention, filing an industrial design application under the Paris Convention provides six months period to the applicant to claim priority from the original industrial design application in any of the member states of the Paris Convention.</p>

              <div id="Copyright_Overview" class="tabcontent">
                <h2> Copyright Overview</h2>
                <hr>
                   <p>While patent law protects the novel and creative ideas of inventors, copyright law protects any original expressions of authors and writers even if the said expressions are spontaneous, artless, and has no level of creativity. With this slight overview, we can see how extensive rights that could easily be protected by copyright law.</p>
                <br>
                  <p>The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, usually known as the "Berne Convention", is an international copyright agreement composed of different countries thereby constituting a Union (Berne Union) for the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works. The Convention provides that copyright protection may not be conditioned on compliance with any formality, such as registration or deposit of copies. However, the basic elements of protection under the Berne Convention must be strictly observed in such a way that copyrights will be protected by requiring the signatories to honor and recognize the rights of all authors who are nationals of countries which are party to the Convention and that the laws of signatory States must provide the minimum levels of protection established by the Convention.</p>
                <br>
                  <p>Another principal international convention for the protection of copyright is the "Universal Copyright Convention". It was created as an alternative to the Berne Convention for those states which are non-signatory to the Berne Convention but still wants to participate in some form of multilateral copyright protection. Some Berne Convention states also became party to the UCC so that their copyrights could be protected in states which are non-signatory to the Berne Convention.</p>
                <br>
                  <p>The differences between Berne Convention and Universal Copyright Convention are with respect to duration of protection and formal requirements. As to duration of protection, the normal copyright protection mandated by the Berne Convention shall be during the lifetime of the author plus another 50 years from the time of
                death, subject to certain exceptions. On the other hand, the duration of copyright protection provided by the Universal Copyright Convention shall be during the lifetime of the author and not less than 25 years after the death of the author, subject to certain exceptions. With regard to formal requirements, the copyright protection under the Berne Convention does not depend on any formality, while the Universal Copyright Convention requires certain formalities as condition for copyright protection.</p>
                <br>
                  <p>On the other hand, Rome Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations, otherwise known as "Rome Convention", was drafted in order to secure protection in performances of performers, phonograms of producers of phonograms and broadcasts of broadcasting organizations.</p>
